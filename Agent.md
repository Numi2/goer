# Project Overview

This repository contains an example iOS application named **Goer** that demonstrates tracking workouts with HealthKit and presenting information using a Widget / Live Activity. The code is organised into several top-level folders:

- `Shared`: SwiftUI components that are reused across the app and the widget.
- `WorkoutWidget`: Implementation of the Live Activity widget.
- `WorkoutsOniOSSampleApp`: The main iOS application.
- `Configuration`: Xcode build configuration file.
- `WorkoutsOniOSSampleApp.xcodeproj`: Xcode project settings.

Below is an explanation of each file and how the pieces fit together.

## Shared

### `ElapsedTimeView.swift`
Displays the workout's elapsed time using a custom formatter.

### `MetricsModel.swift`
Model object that stores metrics such as heart rate, active energy, distance, and speed. It also provides helper methods to format those values for display.

## WorkoutWidget

### `WorkoutWidgetBundle.swift`
Declares the widget bundle entry point and registers the Live Activity widget.

### `WorkoutWidgetLiveActivity.swift`
Defines the Live Activity configuration using `ActivityConfiguration` and sets up the dynamic island views.

### `LiveActivityView.swift`
SwiftUI view presented inside the Live Activity to show metrics like elapsed time, heart rate and energy.

### `WorkoutWidgetViewModel.swift`
`Observable` class that manages creating, updating and ending the Live Activity instance.

### `WorkoutWidgetsAttributes.swift`
`ActivityAttributes` type describing the fixed and dynamic state values used by the Live Activity.

### Assets & `Info.plist`
Images and widget configuration for the Live Activity target.

## WorkoutsOniOSSampleApp

### `CountDownManager.swift`
Handles a short countdown before starting a workout session.

### `HKWorkout+HKWorkoutConfiguration.swift`
Extension on `HKWorkout` to create the related `HKWorkoutConfiguration` object.

### `NavigationModel.swift`
`Observable` model that drives app navigation between the start view, countdown, active session and summary views.

### `WorkoutManager.swift`
Main controller that manages HealthKit sessions, collects workout metrics and communicates with the widget model. It requests HealthKit authorisation, starts/ends workouts and updates metrics as samples arrive.

### `WorkoutTypes.swift`
Utility helpers to describe supported workout types and provide convenience properties like name, symbol and whether a workout supports distance or speed metrics.

### `WorkoutsOniOSSampleApp.swift`
SwiftUI `App` entry point. It initialises the navigation model and hosts the different views depending on the workout state.

### `WorkoutsOniOSSampleAppDelegate.swift`
`UIApplicationDelegate` implementation used for workout recovery and intent handling integration.

### `WorkoutsOniOSSampleAppSceneDelegate.swift`
Minimal `UIWindowSceneDelegate` required to support the app delegate's scene configuration method.

### `Intent/IntentHandler.swift`
Implements Siri workout intents so workouts can be started, paused, resumed and ended via Siri or App Intents.

### Views
- `ControlsView.swift` – start/stop/pause buttons during a session.
- `CountDownView.swift` – shows the pre‑workout countdown animation.
- `MetricsView.swift` – displays metrics while the workout is running using a `TimelineView`.
- `SessionView.swift` – combines the metrics and controls into a single screen.
- `StartView.swift` – lets the user pick a workout type and request HealthKit authorisation.
- `SummaryView.swift` – shows results after the workout finishes.

### `WorkoutsOniOSSampleApp.entitlements`
Entitlements enabling HealthKit and Siri support.

### `Info.plist`
Application configuration used by iOS.

### `Assets.xcassets` and `Preview Content`
App icon, preview assets and related resources.

## Configuration

### `SampleCode.xcconfig`
Xcode configuration file containing sample code settings.

## Xcode Project
The `WorkoutsOniOSSampleApp.xcodeproj` folder holds the Xcode project and scheme used to build both the app and the widget targets.

## How it Works
1. **StartView** presents a list of workout types. Selecting one sets up a `HKWorkoutConfiguration` on the `WorkoutManager`.
2. The `WorkoutManager` prepares a session and the `NavigationModel` transitions to `CountDownView`.
3. When the countdown completes, `WorkoutManager` starts the workout, begins collecting HealthKit metrics and launches a Live Activity via `WorkoutWidgetViewModel`.
4. `SessionView` displays current metrics while the Live Activity mirrors the same information on the Lock Screen or Dynamic Island.
5. When the user stops the workout, metrics are finalised and `SummaryView` presents the results.
6. The Live Activity is ended and eventually dismissed.

This overview should help future contributors understand where functionality lives and how the files work together.

+ # Liquid Glass Design System Implementation Summary
+ 
+ ## Overview
+ 
+ Successfully implemented a clean, minimal Liquid Glass design system throughout the Goer workout app, following Apple's actual design principles. The implementation uses system materials and avoids overly complex custom effects, as recommended by Apple's documentation.
+ 
+ ## Design Principles Applied
+ 
+ ### 1. **System Materials First**
+ - Uses `.ultraThinMaterial` as the primary glass effect
+ - Leverages `.thinMaterial` for lighter variants
+ - Avoids complex custom glass effects
+ 
+ ### 2. **Consistent Corner Radius**
+ - Standardized on 16pt corner radius with `RoundedRectangle`
+ - Uses 12pt for smaller elements like buttons
+ - Maintains visual consistency across all components
+ 
+ ### 3. **Clean Typography & Spacing**
+ - Uses system fonts and weights
+ - Consistent spacing patterns (12pt, 16pt, 24pt)
+ - Proper semantic color usage
+ 
+ ### 4. **Simplified Animations**
+ - Removed complex particle effects and custom animations
+ - Uses system-provided animations where appropriate
+ - Maintains smooth, purposeful transitions
+ 
+ ## Files Updated
+
